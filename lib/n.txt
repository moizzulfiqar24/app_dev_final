Ok lets work on the cards screen.
 
Clicking on Cards on navigation should lead to cards_screen.dart

Its a static UI screen, based on the provided design (image attached). No Firebase, Bloc, or API integration required. Focus on UI layout and clean design only using pure Flutter widgets. Ensure the
screen is scrollable on all devices.

Requirements:
● Use dummy data (static values) — no Firebase or backend.
● Design must include:
   ○ Use any three bank card image in page view.
   ○ Bottom app bar should select cards tab here.
   ○ User proper gradient color in background.
   ○ Show last activity transaction list.

The three cards images are added in assets/images/card1.jpg assets/images/card2.jpg assets/images/card3.jpg
